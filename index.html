        <h2> Second Assignment: Avatar</h2>
        <h3>November 3</h3>
        <p>I was unsure what I was supposed to pick for the avatar section of this assignemnt, so I went ahead and just
            chose a cartoon
            character that I like. This character would be: <a href=https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Toph_Beifong>Toph
                Beifong from <em><cite>Avatar the Last
                        Airbender</cite></em></a></p>
        <figure>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toph_Beifong"><img src="images/Toph_Beifong-thumb.png"
                    alt="Azula thumbnail"></a>
            <figcaption>Toph Beifong, linked to original wiki</figcaption>
        </figure>


        <p class="bold">The following information will be copied from the AvatarWiki</p>
        <p class="quote">Beifong is an earthbending master, one of the most powerful of her time, and the discoverer
            of
            metalbending. Blind since birth, Toph was constantly treated condescendingly because of her visual
            impairment, particularly by her overprotective parents, Lao and Poppy Beifong. Upon discovering
            badgermoles, earthbending animals who are also blind, she learned how to use earthbending as an
            extension of her senses. This gave her the ability to "see" every vibration that passes through the
            ground.</p>
        <p class="quote">Having developed her own unique style of earthbending, Toph acquired a toughened personality
            and
            became famous for winning underground earthbending tournaments under the alias "The Blind Bandit",
            doing so behind her parents' backs. Although initially uninterested in directly aiding the war
            effort, she eventually chose to leave behind her old life, and travel with Avatar Aang and his
            friends as his earthbending teacher, when her parents finally became unbearable for her. Toph's
            total mastery over earthbending, unique personality, and thoughtful pragmatism made her a valuable
            addition to the team.</p>
