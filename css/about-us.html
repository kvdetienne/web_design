        <h2> <em>Second Assignment: Avatar</em></h2>
        <h3>November 3</h3>
        <p>I was unsure what I was supposed to pick for the avatar section of this assignemnt, so I went ahead and just
            chose a cartoon
            character that I like. This character would be:</p>
        <a href=https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Toph_Beifong><strong> Toph Beifong from <em><cite>Avatar the Last
                        Airbender</cite></em></strong></a>
        <p><strong>The following information will be copied from the AvatarWiki</strong></p>
        <p><em><q>Toph Beifong is an earthbending master, one of the most powerful of her time, and the discoverer of
                    metalbending. Blind since birth, Toph was constantly treated condescendingly because of her visual
                    impairment, particularly by her overprotective parents, Lao and Poppy Beifong. Upon discovering
                    badgermoles, earthbending animals who are also blind, she learned how to use earthbending as an
                    extension of her senses. This gave her the ability to "see" every vibration that passes through the
                    ground.</q></em></p>
        <p><em><q>Having developed her own unique style of earthbending, Toph acquired a toughened personality and
                    became famous for winning underground earthbending tournaments under the alias "The Blind Bandit",
                    doing so behind her parents' backs. Although initially uninterested in directly aiding the war
                    effort, she eventually chose to leave behind her old life, and travel with Avatar Aang and his
                    friends as his earthbending teacher, when her parents finally became unbearable for her. Toph's
                    total mastery over earthbending, unique personality, and thoughtful pragmatism made her a valuable
                    addition to the team.</q></em></p>
